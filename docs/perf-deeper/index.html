<h1>Always measure one level deeper</h1>
<p>2025-06-19</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3213770">John Ousterhout</a> explains how
performance evaluation is more marketing than science and how to do it correctly</p>
<h2>Most common mistakes</h2>
<h3>1. Trusting the numbers</h3>
<p>Bugs in performance measurement code do not causes crashes or failures. They
simply give the wrong numbers and hence engineers think everything is working as
expected. But this is not the case. There may be bugs in the benchmarks / tests,
in the code that gathers metrics (99th percentile being miscomputed), the system
may have functional or performance bugs</p>
<h3>2. Guessing instead of measuring</h3>
<p>Making unsubstantiated claims based on intuition is common. People claim "what
else could the reason be?", implying that it is up to others to prove the theory
wrong and it's okay to guess until proven false. In some case the person making
the comment feels like a process of elimination has been used and that every
possible cause has been considered. But the causes are ususally non-obvious to
find without measuring</p>
<h3>3. Superficial measurements</h3>
<p>Only measuring the outermost visible behavior of a system such as overall
running time of an application. These are necessary but not sufficient. They
still lead of some unanswered questions - what causes the greatest improvements?
What are the limits to better performance? etc. We need to measure deeper in
addition to top-level measurements</p>
<h3>4. Confirmation bias</h3>
<p>This causes people to select and interpret data that supports their hypotheses.
It affects your level of trust. If you expect your system to perform better and
see results that supports this, you will likely accept the results without
questions. Another example is picking metrics that make your system look good.
This is more marketing than science and is ineffective when you want to uncover
the truth about a system</p>
<h3>5. Haste</h3>
<p>Building the system takes more time than expected. You have a deadline to meet,
so performance measurement is done in haste leading to sloppiness</p>
<h2>Keys to high-quality performance analysis</h2>
<h3>1. Allow lots of time</h3>
<p>To measure, analyze and fix</p>
<h3>2. Never trust a number generated by a computer</h3>
<p>Performance measurements should be considered guilty until proven innocent. Take
different measurements at the same level, measure the system at a lower level,
make back-of-the-envelope calculations to see if they are in the ballpark
expected, run simulations and compare results to measurements of the real
implementation. Always questions thing you don't understand. Curmudgeons make
good performance evaluators because they trust nothing and enjoy finding
problems</p>
<h3>3. Use your intuition to ask questions, not to answer them</h3>
<p>Your intuition can save you lots of time and effort, but should not make your
overconfident. Back your intuition with data before making decisions or claims</p>
<h3>4. Always measure one level deeper</h3>
<p>Break down the top-level measurements into smaller measurements until you find
the cause of contradictions or surprising things</p>
<h2>Measurement infrastructure</h2>
<p>Some other investments that pay for itself in the long run: automation,
dashboards, presentation of data</p>
